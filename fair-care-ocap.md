## How FAIR, CARE, and OCAP are applied in this research
The members of this research effort, including lead organization [NAME of ORGANIZATION] acknowledges importance of Force11 FAIR Data principles (1), the GIDA CARE principles (2), and the First Nations Principles of OCAP (3). Applying these information management frameworks to protect the interests and considerations of Indigenous rightsholders engaged by this data management effort is a priority. The FAIR Data principles prioritize research outputs that are findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable for the broader research community. FAIR’s secondary concerns are with regards to reproducibility of science, and the long term preservation/archiving of scientific data. The CARE principles call for information sharing that addresses collective benefit, authority to control, and responsible and ethical sharing, with an emphasis placed on Indigenous self-determination and sovereignty. The First Nations Principles of OCAP, like the CARE principles, seek to apply best practice with regards to Indigenous and tribal ownership, control, access, and possession of research products on behalf of Indigenous communities, lands, cultural heritage or other intellectual property. 

Inherent tension lies between the emphasis of FAIR to ensure broadest possible access & re-usability, and the considerations of CARE and OCAP to protect and preserve Indigenous sovereignty and self-determination within a sharing framework. Compounding this tension is a complex negotiation between collectivism and collective concerns of Indigenous communities and their knowledge, and individualistic considerations of Western research and scientific publishing frameworks. One additional consideration is the Western research concept of interoperability, that relies on a prescribed granularity of information, often reducing information to a single observation or single numerical data point. Indigenous Knowledge is informed by a holistic worldview that relies on contextual, multi-dimensional, and multi-generational knowing; and as such is often incompatible with the granularity or scalar-concerned interoperability as described by FAIR. Below, [ NAME of ORGANIZATION ]  has described how these guidelines and principles are being applied (or not applied) with regards to this research and its information management.
